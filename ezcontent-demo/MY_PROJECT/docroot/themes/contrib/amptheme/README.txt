AMPTheme
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This theme is for use with the AMP module (https://www.drupal.org/amp). This
version of the theme is for use with the 8.3 version of the AMP module, and
will not work with earlier versions.

These themes can be used as AMP themes, or be subthemed or used as examples for
creating custom AMP themes.

These themes are not required for AMP 8.3 to work, as long as you are using some
theme that adheres to the AMP requirements.
